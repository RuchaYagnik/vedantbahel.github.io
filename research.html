									<h3> Past Research Projects</h3> <br>
									<h4>1. COVID Assistive System</h4> 
									<B>Personal Project </B> 
									<p><I> Co-Researchers: Prof. Sofia Pillai, Galgotias University</I></p>
									<p>The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has caused a huge disturbance globally. The problem is the unavailability of vaccines and limited resources for its detection. In this paper, authors have carried out a case study of India to analyse the problem faced by the authorities for detecting COVID-19 amongst the suspected cases and have tried to solve the problem using a Deep Neural Network-based approach for analyzing chest x-rays in order to detect the onset/presence of related disease. After obtaining data from available resources, we trained a transfer learning-based CNN model. The model tries to extract the features of the radiographs and thus classifies it into the appropriate class. Heat map filter was use on the images significantly helping the model to perform better. This paper presents the validation of the model on certain test images and shows that the model is reliable to an extent. This paper also demonstrates a general architecture for the deployment of the model as per the considered case study.</p>
								
									<h4>2. Disease detection using Radiograph</h4> 
									<B>Personal Project </B> 
									<p><I> Co-Researchers: Mr Parag Ghorpade & Mr. Hrishikesh Mane</I></p>
									<p>There are many diseases associated with lungs or thoracic cavity and the diagnosis of these diseases at once becomes difficult for any medical profusion. The most common way of screening done when the thoracic cavity comes into the picture is Chest Radiography. However, diagnosing multiple diseases from a single scan becomes difficult. This paper proposes an intelligent machine learning-based model which tries to detect 14 chest diseases out from a single radiograph with greater accuracy. This paper makes use of advanced deep learning techniques like neural networks, masking algorithms, etc. to assure higher performances.</p>

									<h4>3. Knowledge Discovery in EDM</h4> 
									<B>Associated with Research Intern at CoE in AI & ML, GHRCE </B> 
									<p><I> Co-Researchers: Prof. A. Thomas, GHRCE & Dr. Preeti Bajaj, Galgotias University</I></p>
									<p>India ranks third in the higher education after United States and China. However, advanced learning management system is not widely used or accepted in India as compared to its counterparts. The reason may be due to highly diverse population, huge size, variable quality and many strengths & weaknesses leading to various problems. Such problems can be addressed using Educational Data Mining. Educational Data Mining is an area of research that makes use of data that Educational institutes hold and bring out potential insights to improve its system. There are various applications of EDM in the domain which not only focuses on learner's improvement but also help educators to improve their learning environment. And each of the application may require different algorithms, tools or data mining techniques. This paper discusses the major areas where EDM tools and techniques can be applied in the Indian context.</p>

									<h4>4. Swarm Robotics</h4> 
									<B>Associated with Student at GHRCE </B> 
									<p><I> Co-Researchers: Mr. Atharva Peshkar & Dr. Sugandha Singh, GHRCE</I></p>
									<p>In the era of rapid modernisation, automation and robotics play an important role in our day-to-day lives. With the growing influence of robots in almost every sector, it has become a reason for tech corporations as well as academia to work on the cost efficiency measures whilst also improving the quality of service (QoS) of this technologically advanced equipment. The relative study of swarm robots and their advantages over traditional robotic system has been an intriguing field of research over the last few years. Rapid development in the domain of sensors, networking, communication, miniaturisation and mainly machine learning has made it possible and given a boost to the development of a simple autonomous, decentralised and self-organised system of swarm robots, inspired by various natural species, giving birth to the field of swarm intelligence. This paper aims to outline the use, brief the basic architecture and discuss the implementation of swarm robotics in the field of defence, medicine and search and rescue operations.</p>
